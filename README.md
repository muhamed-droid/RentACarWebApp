To start the project you need to open terminal. Then split that terminal, because you will need to run backend and frontend on them. On one side go to client folder using cd client and than start frontend using npm start. Than navigate another terminal to server folder using cd server. Than start it using npm start. That will run the backend. Frontend will run on localhost:3000, while backend should be running on localhost:3001. 

For every modification dear colleagues Faris and Emin, please use separete branch and than we will merge that branch after all modifications are done with main branch. 

Enjoy!
